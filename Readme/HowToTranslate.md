# Important Points of Translation.
1. You must check English Translation and Translate from English Translation.<br>
The keys are used to programmatically manage.<br>
Therefore, please refer to the English translation that is used in the game as a reference for the translation.<br>
2. You can freely decide the placement of Rockstar's string tags.
Ex: ~s~, ~o~ etc.<br>
3. Don't translate languages you don't understand.<br>
4. {0} and {1} etc. are inserted with different values by the program.<br>
If they are included, please do not delete them.<br>
If it's gone, I don't approve of it.
