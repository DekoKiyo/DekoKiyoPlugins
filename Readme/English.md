We're still in early development, but we'll be adding more features in the future.<br>

[![Lang](./Images/localization.png)](https://github.com/Dekokiyo/DekoKiyoPlugins/wiki#plugin-supported-languages)<br>
DekoKiyo Tools has supported many languages.<br>
If you want to translate this plugin, please tell me on my Discord Server!<br>

[![CT](./Images/custom.png)](https://github.com/Dekokiyo/DekoKiyoPlugins/wiki/CustomTranslationEN)<br>
DekoKiyo Tools is also possible to create custom translations.<br>
Write your translations in the DekoKiyoToolsCustomTranslation.ini file inside plugin/LSPDFR/DekoKiyoPlugins and change the language to "Custom" in the context menu.<br>
Then your translation will be reflected in the game.<br>
If your language is not in this plugin, let me know on the Discord server, and I can include it as standard.<br>
